Level 1

Hidden in plain sight: Hide an object or item that the players need to find in plain sight, but disguise it as something else. For example, a key could be hidden inside a book, or a valuable item could be disguised as a common household object.

Cryptic Clues: Leave cryptic clues around the area that the players must decipher in order to find the next clue or solution to their problem. These clues could take the form of riddles, puzzles, or seemingly unrelated objects that hold a hidden message or significance.

Memory Game: Set up a series of clues and challenges that the players must complete by using their memories. This could involve remembering details from a previous challenge, recalling information from a previous encounter, or using their memory to solve a puzzle or riddle.
